        MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program.
         Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

        Released in February 2009 by 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.), it supports features like sharding, 
        replication, and ACID transactions (from version 4.0). MongoDB Atlas, its managed cloud service, 
        operates on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. Current versions are licensed under 
        the Server Side Public License (SSPL). MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.

        The American software company 10gen began developing MongoDB in 2007 as a component of a planned 
        platform-as-a-service product. In 2009, the company shifted to an open-source development model 
        and began offering commercial support and other services. In 2013, 10gen changed its name to MongoDB Inc.

        On October 30, 2019, MongoDB teamed with Alibaba Cloud to offer Alibaba Cloud customers a 
        MongoDB-as-a-service solution. Customers can use the managed offering from Alibaba's global data centers.
