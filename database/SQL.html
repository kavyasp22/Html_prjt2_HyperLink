        Structured Query Language (SQL) (pronounced /ˌɛsˌkjuˈɛl/ S-Q-L; or alternatively as /ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel") 
        is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
         It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. 
        Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates 
        the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.
    </p>
    <p>
        Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements
        which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL),
         Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).
    </p>
    <p>
        SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization
         for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to include a larger set of 
         features and incorporate common extensions. Despite the existence of standards, virtually no implementations in existence
          adhere to it fully, and most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.
