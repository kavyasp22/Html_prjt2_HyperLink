    <p>
        Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that 
        can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript 
        engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. 
        The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content 
        before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript 
        everywhere" paradigm,unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as 
        opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to 
        optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well 
        as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and 
        has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated 
        by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.
