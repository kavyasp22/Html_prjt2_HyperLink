        The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web 
        applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. The framework does not impose any specific 
        programming model.[citation needed]. The framework has become popular in the Java community as an addition to 
        the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Spring Framework is free and open source software.
    </p>
    <p>
        Spring Framework 6.0 has been released on 16 November 2022 and came with a Java 17+ baseline and a move to Jakarta EE 9+ 
        (in the jakarta namespace), with a focus on the recently released Jakarta EE 10 APIs such as Servlet 6.0 and JPA 3.1.
