         mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design
          templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

        Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative 
        web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to
         apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary 
         factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, 
         Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance 
         for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage 
         of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, 
         Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes,
          and text with a highlight.
