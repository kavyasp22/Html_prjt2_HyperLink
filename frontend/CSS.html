        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation 
        and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for 
        its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
         enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which 
         reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve 
         the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for 
        different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and
         on Braille-based tactile devices.CSS also has rules for alternative formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
